#summary Main information.

= Introduction =

This is the Main Page. Before you can start working, you need to set up a POL 098 environment. You will need to download a POL 097 distro and the POL 098 binaries. They include documentation on how to generate the realms and set things up.

After that, you delete the pkg and scripts from that, and add the WoD scripts for POL 098 from the SVN repository. 

If you need more help, contact Sheng or Natalia and they will guide you.
