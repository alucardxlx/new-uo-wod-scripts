The tasks follow


= Details =

  * Restore the old package structure as much as possible. This would not be necesary if we were to start a new server, but is *ABSOLUTELY NECESARY* for migrating from the live WoD server, as great part of the saved data makes reference to package names, script names and package structure.

  * Also verify the functionality of each entry in the pkg folder, make sure everything is realm aware. Currently it uses {{{_DEFAULT_REALM}}}; this should be replaced with the _realm_ property of the character, npc or object in question to permit us to expand to the other realms in the future.

Each one of us should pick one by one the folders inside 095\pkg and compare them with 098\pkg, and do the necesary work to accomplish the tasks mentioned above.

Here is the package list and those assigned to them in parenthesis:
  * character
  * combat
  * drocket
  * dundee
  * guilds
  * items
  * magic
  * merchants_database
  * npcs (Agata)
